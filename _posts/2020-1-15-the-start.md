title: The Start

Have you ever though of how you got to where you are in life and specifically in your career? How many of us are in an occupation that is not what we set out to be in when starting our career or starting college? I am willing to bet the number is significant.

My story starts with a fascination with cars that lead me to go into Mechanical Engineering. Along the way I wanted to become an Orthopedic Surgeon but stuck with Mechie as my curiculum because of the obvious crossover. Once in college I fell in love with Engineering so much I did not want to leave it so I decided to scuttle the idea of being a surgeon - one of the best, if not the best, decesion I ever made in my life.
