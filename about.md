My fascination with computers started when I was in high school learning BASIC on an Apple IIe printing the text to one of my favorite bands on the screen line by line - Nirvana "In Utero" had just been released. Today I am a Solutions Architect, and it is my pleasure to make computers work for me to achieve my goals.

I did not start my career in software and IT. I had another passion that took me into mechanical engineering, cars. In college, I began to apply my passion for computers with my love of cars. I eventually found myself writing code to solve computational fluid dynamics problems. I took my hobby, my passion and turned it into my career. For my professional life, that has been my greatest accomplishment. As a prior mechanical and electronics engineer, I approach challenges with the same rigor as the people that design aircraft where failure is not an option.

The majority of my career has been with the US Government starting from college as an electronics engineer on aircraft progressing to software development. I had the opportunity to work on multi-billion dollar programs to small software development projects, and I gained a tremendous amount of program management experience during that time. It enabled me to experience both waterfall and agile methodologies.

My tools of the trade are very cloud-centric. I started operating my own web hosting business in 2003 when everything was hard-iron as either owned or leased hardware. Because of those experiences, I have an extraordinary appreciation for using infrastructure and platforms as a service. 

### More Information

My passions in life outside of computers are Mountain Biking and Snowboarding. During the warm months, you will find me on chairlifts riding bike parks and in the winter on those same chairlifts with a snowboard.

I am the proud husband to a wonderful wife and the father to a beautiful little daughter.
